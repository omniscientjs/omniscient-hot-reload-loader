# omniscient with react hot loader

Coupling [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) with your omniscient application, your omniscient components automatically hot reload without needing a page refresh as you change the source code of your application, with your app's state kept in tact.

As of react hot loader version 1.0, no source code changes are needed on the client side to enable hot reloading for your application.

## setup

- install with `npm i`
- run the hot reloading server `npm run start`
- load up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- watch your omniscient app hot reload while you edit and save the `clicks.js` component in your editor!
